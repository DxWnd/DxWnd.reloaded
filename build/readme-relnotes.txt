v2.02.03/04:
code cleanup - see syslib calls hooking
new configuration flags: Hook GDI and Hook OpenGL
OpenGL custom library field
API hooking fix with module specification

Updated "Fixed aspect ratio" option: now uses the x,y size declared in the configuration instead of the fixed 800 x 600 standard one.
Added virtual fullscreen "Desktop" mode.
Completely revised the Peek/GetMessage handling: now it uses the standard SetWindowHook API instead of the address redirection, making the handling more reliable and accurate: now "Age of Empires III" works at last!
GUI:
Added virtual fullscreen "Desktop" mode.
Added "Fix buffered IO after Win98" flag: this is meant to fix an incompatibility in the ReadFile kernel32 API that must read from block boundaries, where a block was smaller up to Win98 and bigger after it.
As a result, games like "Dylan Dog Horror Luna Park" show IO errors while reading data from the CD. Unfortunately, this is not the only problem of this game, so Dylan Dog fans will have to wait further.
Maybe some other programs suffer of this problem, and I will strongly appreciate if anyone finds some.

v2.02.35
fixed BACKBUFFER surface attributes in direct (not emulated) mode: Rayman 2 playable again
added FILTERMESSAGES flag ("filter offending messages") to eliminate some problems to games not developed to work windowized (Rayman 2, Mirror's Edge ...)
fixed bug crashing the program when "keep aspect ratio" is selected with window size set to 0

v2.02.36

Fixed a bug in GDI "Map DC to primary surface"mode.
Added palette display window to GUI

v2.02.41
Added "suppress child process creation"flag. This flag is introduced to manage games such as "Heart of Iron 2" that start intro movie by means of a separate process. HoI2 is starting the binkplay.exe program in the game's avi subfolder. This way you don't get a windowed movie, but completely suppress it.

v2.02.42
added hook to kernel32.dll QueryPerformanceCounter API to enable time stretching to Rayman 2
handled GetAttachedSurface emulation for FLIP capability on primary surface - that makes the intro movies of Empire Earth visible.
Some code cleaning
Cleared invisible debug flags ...

v2.02.43
Several changes for Empire Earth:
fix: restore 16BPP color mode after directdraw session termination
fix: recovered window destruction

v2.02.44
Improved debug logging for all palette operations
fixed a bugged log causing the crash of Empire Earth in debug mode
added show time stretching flag - preliminary version. Some code cleaning as well.

added a static definition for the default system palette
added interception for CoCreateInstance following cases:
	case 0xe436ebb3: Module="quartz"; Class="CLSID_FilterGraph";
	case 0x4fd2a832: Module="ddrawex"; Class="CLSID_DirectDrawEx";
	case 0x49c47ce5: Module="amstream"; Class="CLSID_AMMultiMediaStream";
preliminary (proxed) interception for "GetActiveWindow" and "GetForegroundWindow"

v2.02.45
A small fix for ddraw 7 games that makes Praetorians playable, though with some problems!

v2.02.46
Fixed handling of user32 CreateDialogIndirectParam call to avoid processing in non fullscreen mode - fix necessary to start "Crimson Skies".

v2.02.47
GUI:
Configuration tabs reorganization: now some tabs have merged making it easier to reach all options
core:
improved d3d wrapping and sdded ZBUFFER cleanup flags to fix some d3d games. In particular:
Clean ZBUFFER @1.0 fix: to fix "Star Wars Episode I Racer"
Clean ZBUFFER @0.0 fix: to fix "Crimson Skies" black blocks bug on ATI cards

v2.02.48
New options: "Disable fogging", "Textures not power of 2 fix"
A few fix to prevent game crashes

v2.02.49
Separated ddraw, d3d and dxwnd log messages
Hooked GetAvailableVidMem method to limit memory values
Hooked ChangeDisplaySettings call in both versions ANSI and WIDECHAR, to prevent messing up with the screen
Added HookWindowProc() subroutine, called at dxhook.c@1534

Hooked d3d8/9 SetCursorPosition method
Hooked d3d8/9 AddRef / release methods (for logging)
Fixed D3DDevice8/9 hooking
Hooked QueryPerformanceFrequency
Fixed a bug in d3d7 hooking
GUI: added desktop color setting

v2.02.50
Added "Intercept RDTSC" option: so far, tested on Unreal Tournament only.
To implement RDTSC detection, I owe a big thank you to Olly who shared the disasm lib used to browse the assembly code.

v2.02.51/52
Hooked window timers: now "Ed Hunter" can be time stretched
added NOFILLRECT debug option
fixed WM_DISPLAYCHANGE handling (x,y swapped coordinates?)
fixed int64 arithmetic for performance counters
Added (untested !!!) handling for RDTSCP opcode with "Intercept RDTSC" option
Added "Limit screen resolution" option: seems necessary for "Sid Meyer's Civilization III" to work
Improved initial window coordinate & style handling
fixed virtual screen size showing into status panel
hooked SetPixelFormat, GetPixelFormat, ChoosePixelFormat and DescribePixelFormat to redirect desktop hwnd and make wglCreateContext work (needed for Civ III)

hooked DisableD3DSpy (invoked by The Bard's Tale)
fixed extglViewport coordinate remapping when invoked with CW_USEDEFAULT values (Civ III)
fixed bug in DirectDarawCreate/Ex hooking with wrong module handle

v2.02.53
Handling of ddraw screen color depth 15BPP - in "Hesperian Wars"

hooked SystemParametersInfo call
fixed window size logic to check for window menu bar, considering also the WS_CHILD case.
fixed window move/resize when message processing is enabled: coordinates outside the child area or within ENTER/EXITSIZEMOVE must NOT be altered.
expanded timer processing to include user32 Set/KillTimer - in "Aaron Hall's Dungeon Odissey"
fixed possible recursion while hooking child window procedure identical to parent's one
fixed gdi emulation on top of ddraw surface, enough to play "Sid Meyer's Civilization III".

v2.02.54
fixed a bug in d3d GetAvailableVidMem that was causing too many troubles...
fixed a bug in Suppress IME option
fixed a bug in handled library list, possibly affecting d3d/d3d7 games
avoid fixing window style for non-desktop windows (fixed a Port Royale 2 bug)

some incomplete work on gdi game handling
added preliminary, incomplete (not working) glide handling

v2.02.55

fixed WS_NCCALCSIZE & WM_NCPAINT messages to ensure a proper window's border and size - fixed Black Thorn window problems
fixed "Hide desktop background" flag 

v2.02.58
Added Automatic DirectX mode: not workink always, but should make it much easier to guess a proper surface setting.
Automatic mode allows dynamic mode change depending on the situation: it is necessary for Populous 3 D3D version.
fixed BltFast operation with SRC color key (often used to draw cursor from texures) directly to primary surface: this makes the cursor visible in Populous 3.
minor fixes on logging

v2.02.59
fixed IDIrectDraw reference counter for ddraw release 1 session: fixes "Warhammer 40K Rites Of War" first screen

v2.02.61
added directx "Compensate Flip emulation" flag: used primarily to get rid of mouse artifacts due to emulated Flip rpocedure in windowed mode. Fixes Gruntz issues and some other games...

v2.02.62
fixed d3d7 CreateDevice hook and d3d7 rendering options (wireframe, disablefogging, zbufferalways)
fixed doublebuffer emulation - avoid returning the backbuffer when zbuffer is requested. Fixes rendering problems of many games!

v2.02.63
fixed d3d hooking for Reset and GetDirect3D methods: now Jumpgate works at any available resolution, and the "Add proxy libs" option is no longer necessary
fixed "Compensate Flip emulation" option for non emulated surface mode: fixes mouse artifacts for "Rogue Spear Black Thorn" 
added preliminary handling for "Disable Textures" option

v2.02.64
GUI: implemented multiple file import
DLL:
fixed a ddraw session reference count error that prevented "Jet Moto" to start
fixed "Compensate Flip emulation" for ddraw7 games: now "Empire Earth" supports this flag.
fixed CloseWindow hook: now games that minimize/restore the main window on task switch can possibly recover (e.g. Hundred Swords)
fixed process hook: now it should be a little more robust and efficient. Hopefully should fix some Macromedia Flash problems.
fixed IDDrawSurface::Lock() prototype. Not gameplay improvements, though...
added DirectX "Return 0 ref counter" option as quick & dirty solution to many reference counter problems!
fixed DirectDrawCreateEx failing to register the main ddraw session handle
fixed palette problem in emulated mode: palette must be applied to backbuffer surface as well. Now "Duckman" and "Total Soccer 2000" show perfect colors.

v2.02.65
added "Fine time adjust" flag to finely set timeslider by 10% steps ranging from about :2 to x2
fixed a bug in DWORD timers introduced in v2.02.60: now "Warcraft 2" timing works again
revised logit to calculate delays to emulate VSync timing - now should be more accurate and depending on actual screen refresh rate

v2.02.66
fixed palette bug: "Virtua Fighter PC" now shows correct colors.

v2.02.67
fixed log for D3D CreateDevice method, missing in some D3D interface versions
added wildcarded program path: now you needn't set the full pathname, but it is sufficient to specify the rightmost part, e.g. the executable filename.
added emulated mode color conversion from 32BPP to 16BPP. Despite the fact that the best way to run a 32BPP game is against a 32BPP desktop, now it is possible to downgrade 32BPP colors to 16BPP. This fixed the fact that 32BPP games run on a 16BPP desktop showed simply black screens (e.g. Baldur's Gate II)
fixed logic for EnumDisplayModes implementation: now screen resolutions and, for emulated mode only, also color depth, are generated by DxWnd and not derived directly from the real ones. This make it possible to fake support for very low screen resolutions (e.g. 320x200) on modern screens that support them no longer. This make "Genocide" running on both supported resolutions 320x200 and 320x240.
