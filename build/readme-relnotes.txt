v2.2.00/01
major code rewriting - introduced dxwCore class
preliminary FPS handling: Limit, Skip & Count with configurable delay
Hide Multi Monitor configuration flag - used for "Dream Acquarium" on multimonitor PC.

v2.2.02
preliminary time stretching: so far applies to GetTickCount() only, and is controlled by Alt-F5 / F6 keys.
Fixed bug in GDI BitBlt call: stretching must be made on screen DC only, or it's made twice.

v2.02.03/04:
code cleanup - see syslib calls hooking
new configuration flags: Hook GDI and Hook OpenGL
OpenGL custom library field
API hooking fix with module specification
Time stretching by keyboard control (Alt F5/F6) and/or Time Slider dialog

v2.02.05:
hooked winmm timeGetTime() API: makes time stretching work for Age of Empires series
changed time stretching grain: now it's not the coarse grained 2x, 4x,... series in 9 possible values but the fine grained series 1.5x, 2x, 3x,.... in 17 possible values
added status and time stretching view panels to tray icon menu

v2.02.06:
preliminary FPS counter overlapped on game screen, Alt-F7 to toggle display on/off.
fixed buf on time stretch logging (and possible game crash).
revised GetDC handling with 8BPP paletized surfaces: avoided need to emulate reverse-blitting and got an impressive speed improvement for games such as Age of Empires I & II and Hyperblade.

v2.02.07:
many fixes on the FPS and time control features.

v2.02.08:
fixed some errors in the main directdraw palette descriptor. That gives better compatibility and less complicated source code.
added Fake Version feature: now Dungeon Keeper II (original version, not GOG hack) can detect a fake Win2000 / WinXP environment on Win7 and newer. Tested and working on Win7. Many thanks to Maxim for pushing me hard to win my lazyness and implement this new feature.

v2.02.09:
Fixed some x,y window coordinates bugs
Fixed some proxy log messages (missing \n line terminator)
Fixed Trace "DirectX" flag.
improved GetDC handling in 8BPP palette mode: AddPalette called on demand, and on any surface (including backbuffers): makes Emergency work with no "Handle DC" flag set. Beware: this may affect the "Map GDI HDC on Primary DC" flag causing surface locks.
Fixed limit FPS timing issues: now the max possible FPS is 1000/delay.
Fixed EndPaint bug causing HDC lock in "Map GDI HDC to Primary DC" mode.

v2.02.10:
Added "Full RECT Blit" mode: may be useful to handle problematic situations (e.g. "Urban Assault" intro movies)
Fixed ClientToScreen and ScreenToClient hookers to properly handle scaled windows. This makes "Postal" working.
Fixed global palette reference count (??) in DirectDraw::Release hook
Fixed Window messages handling for SWP_NOMOVE, SWP_NOSIZE modes.

v2.02.11:
Added debug messages for GetSystemMetrics() modes, MapWindowPoints() points, DirectDrawEnumerate/Ex() devices.
ompiled with #define _WIN32_WINNT 0x0600 -> handles Vista modes
Added NOPALETTEUPDATE ("Palette update don't Blit" flag) to eliminate flickering when ddraw and GDI methods conflict
Hooked all LoadLibraryA/W and LoadLibraryExA/W calls
Hooked 
extDirectDrawEnumerate/Ex ddraw calls to handle Hide multi-monitor option.
Detected directshow activation through CoCreateInstance and hooked quartz.dll segment: now Urban Assault movies don't require "Full RECT Blit" option to be set.
Updated DDSurface::Release hook 

v2.02.12
GUI: Tabbed setup panel. More space for more future options.
DLL: (optional) splash screen 
probably, some regression bugs....
